# General Questions to Ask for Product Discovery

This document contains questions to understand whether or not your product idea is useful to real people, and get to the root of people’s real pain points.

The main idea is to spend more time learning about what the end-user actually needs, instead of telling them all about how great your idea is. This provides you with real feedback that you can use to align yourself in the correct direction, without giving yourself biased information.

Most of these questions come from this book: [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/)

### Guidelines for Asking Good Questions
- Talk about their life not yours
- Ask about specifics in the past, not general questions about the future
- Listen more and talk less

### Learning about Pain Points
- What does your current workflow look like
- What have you done to address the current problem?
- How does this issue impact you on a day-to-day basis
- What does your dream product look like?
- Why do you bother?
- What are the implications of that?
- Talk me through the last time that’s happened
- Where does the money come from
- What other questions could I have asked?
- Who else should I talk to?

### Understanding Feature Requests
- Why do you want that?
- What would that let you do?
- How are you currently working around it?
- Should we push back the launch to add that feature?
- How would that fit into your day?

### Understanding Emotional Cues
- Why is this the worst part of your day?
- Can you elaborate more about that?
- Why are you so happy about that?
- That seems to really bug you, I bet there’s a story there
- What makes it so awful?
- Why haven’t you fixed it already?
- You seem pretty excited about that, why is it such a big deal?
- Go on.
- Does this problem matter?
- How seriously do you take X
- Do you make money from it?
- Have you tried making more money from X?
- What tools and services do you currently use for X?
- How much time do you currently spend doing X?
- Do you have any major aspirations for X?
- What are you currently doing to improve it?
- What are the three big things that you’re currently trying to fix or improve right now?


### Potential Risks
- Product risk: Can I build it? Can I grow it?
- Market risk: Do people want it? Will they pay money for it? Are there lots of them?
